    "This lab includes a dissection of crayfish, drawings of crayfish internal and external anatomy and looking at slides and preserved specimens. The diversity in these animals represents diversification resulting from differential fusing of major body segments (tagmatization). This makes them excellent models for understanding how development influences the evolution of morphological diversity. There are **4 required drawings for this lab** and a few other recommended sketches.  Be sure to marvel at the culinary delicacies, and other cool creatures represented in this group.\n",

    "### Crayfish Dissection\n",
    "Unfortunately, the internal structures in these specimens are very fragile.  So the less poking and prodding in your dissection the better.  We should look at the crayfish from two perspectives. Lets have some of you simply make a complete sagittal section.  This involves making a midline cut completely through the body from the anterior to the posterior.  This should give you two symmetrical halves.  A few of you should make a superficial cut through the exoskeleton from anterior to posterior, much like you did last week for the grasshopper. Draw either or both – whatever you need to see all the required structures. \n",

That is, the nauplius is the sole larval form found in several crustacean groups that also retain several other primitive characteristics (i.e. \"common\" does not necessarily equate \"primitive\").  In most  malacostracans, **zoea** larva develop after several molts of the nauplius.  The zoea can then give rise to a post larval form = **megalops**.  Other larval forms which are basically advanced forms of zoea larva exist in other crustaceans such as:  phyllosoma  and mysis (lobster), antizoea (stomatopods or mantis shrimp).  A special larval form exists in the barnacles called a cypris.  Notice how similar they are to an ostracod, as a matter of fact these slides were mislabeled as being ostracods!\n",
