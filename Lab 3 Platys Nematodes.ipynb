    "Today's lab introduces you to the world of animal diversity that is bilaterally symmetrical. We begin with Platyhelminthes, a phylum that includes taxa that are typically supported as the basal clade of **Bilateria**.  I include nemertines here because they look remarkably like Platyhelminthes, but they are entirely unrelated.  This lab also introduces you to the first of three major clades of Bilateria – the **Ecdysozoa**. Since Ecdysozoans include arthropods, we will dwell in this clade for a relatively long time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This group was unrecognized before molecular phylogenetics consistently supported the lineage as monophyletic. The group is united by having a non-cellular chitin that is molted (the molting process=”ecdysis”). The central Ecdysozoan phylum of focus today is Nematoda. A unifying theme between Platyhelminthes and Nematodes is that these groups include a remarkable amount of parasitic lineages.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Today's lab includes a dissection, looking at slides and preserved specimens, and looking at living specimens. Be sure to take time to marvel at the bizarre forms represented in these phyla. There are many required drawings for this lab and a few other recommended sketches.  Be sure to take time to marvel at the bizarreness and disgustingness of some members of this group.  \n",
