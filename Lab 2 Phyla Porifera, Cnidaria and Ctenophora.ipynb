What you are expected to do with the organisms at each station is written out for you in detail in this handout.  **You are required to know all of the taxa and the morphological structures and larval stages that are in bold type.** Upload your required drawings into your copy of this lab using jupyter before Wednesday September 18.  \n",

The sail is composed of a material that has structural properties not unlike those of hyaline cartilage.  The stiffness of the material is somewhere between that of rubber and that of insect cuticle.  The sail's resistance to bending is due to the shape of the sail and the thickened ridges that reinforce it.  Oddly enough there are left-sailing and right-sailing morphs of *Velella*.  Rather than sailing downwind, *Velella* sail at an angle of up to 45 degrees to the wind, either left or right. One explanation for this strange distribution of morphs is that the counter-clockwise circulation of winds in this region tends to push the left sailing morphs closer to shore and the right sailing forms further away.  \n",

How does the bell contract?  *Aurelia* has eight pacemaker ganglia that are each able to generate an impulse that contracts the bell.  When all ganglia are intact, the bell contracts in a rhythmic fashion in stable cycles.  When one ganglion generates an impulse it causes the whole bell to contract and resets all the other ganglia so they can't fire for a refractory period.  If you remove all the ganglia except one, the medusa can still swim but the pattern of contractions becomes irregular.  Where do you think the ganglia are located? How does the bell expand?  The mesoglea of *Aurelia* is composed of a protein and polysaccharide matrix that is slightly less dense than sea water and serves two major swimming functions.  First, it gives the medusa a bit of buoyancy.  Secondly, its resilience causes the bell to reform its pre contraction shape after relaxation of the muscle fibers.  The expansion of the bell is much slower than the contraction, helping the medusa to swim in an aboral direction. \n",
