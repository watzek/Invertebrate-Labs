    "**Take a brachiopod specimen and draw the ventral valve** and label the **pedicle**.  Look closely at the valves and distinguish between dorsal and ventral.  It is important that you make this distinction correctly or you may dissect the animal upside down.  There are several subtle clues: 1. The ventral valve is slightly longer than the dorsal.  Examine the anterior end with the dissecting microscope to determine which is the longer.  This can also be detected by running the edge of a fingernail over the anterior margin of the valves.  If you move the fingernail from dorsal to ventral, it will catch on the slight overshoot of the ventral valve.  On the other hand, if you are moving the nail from ventral to dorsal it will not catch.  2. Both valves are arched outwards to accommodate the body but the ventral valve has a slightly higher arch than the dorsal.  The difference is best seen by looking directly (end-on) at the anterior end.  3. The first 3-4 centimeters of the pedicle arch very slightly dorsally.  These three differences are all small but the are consistent and reliable.  **Find and label dorsal, ventral, anterior, posterior, right,** and **left**.\n",
